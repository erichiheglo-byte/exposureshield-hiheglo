                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>ExposureShield started with a simple observation: most people know they should care about online security, but don't know where to start or what their actual risk looks like.</p>
                
                <p>Existing tools were either too technical, required too much personal data, or created more anxiety than clarity. We built ExposureShield to bridge that gap—providing clear, actionable security insights while respecting your privacy.</p>
